Code generation testing

To test the code generation we did in this assignment, we chose to build various
components piece by piece. We start of writing all the expression codes and
make sure all expressions work. Then we did all the statements. Finally after
we have finished our routine call and return, we combined everything together 
and make sure the whole program works.

In our testing folder, we have test cases for all components of the language.
We also tested some run time errors such as divide by zero and loading an 
undefined value.
