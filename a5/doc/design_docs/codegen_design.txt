CSC488 Assignment 5 -- Code Generator Design Doc -- Group 7

------------------
Update to A4 design regarding routine calls:

To fix the problem of updating the display too early when evaluating
parameters in our A4 design, we have swapped the ordering in which
these operations are handled. Parameters are now evaluated prior to
the display being updated to point to the new activation record.

Parameters are kept at the same offsets as expected previously
(that is, 0 to n - 1 where n is the number of parameters) by
subtracting the number of parameters from the address on the
stack after the PUSHMT instruction. This results in the address
of the first parameter being on the stack for the following SETD
instruction that updates the display.
