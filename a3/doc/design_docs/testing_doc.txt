Semantic Analysis Testing

Document the testing that was done, what test cases
were used, and what parts of the compiler were tested.

We divided our semantic operator tests into passing and failing test cases,
and focused on tests for semantic operators in the declarations, statements 
checking, expression type checking, and functions, procedures and arguments
categories. 

We only wrote failing test cases for tests where we needed to check that 
each kind of identifier being declared was not already declared in the current 
scope. We did not write passing tests for such cases since we used declarations
for all kinds of identifiers in our other passing test cases. Thus, in the 
declarations category, we wrote failing tests for semantic operators s10 - s12, 
s15, s17 - s19, and s48. We also wrote both passing and failing test cases for
semantic operators s46 and s49.

In the statements checking category, we wrote both failing and passing test 
cases for all of those semantic operators. For the s50 failing test we tested
whether an error would occur both when the two kinds of exit statements were
enclosed in non-loop statements, a procedure scope, and when simply stated 
on their own. Similarly for s51, s52 fail tests we tested whether an error
would still occur if return/result statements where stated on their own, 
and in enclosing statements and function scopes etc.
