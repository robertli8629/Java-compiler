AST Testing

To test the AST as we were building it, we chose to build it piece by piece
from the bottom up so that after each step we would have one new testable
part that we could write a program to exercise and use the compiler
to dump the AST's structure (with the -D a option).

We began with a single statement type, the assignment statement, and built
a tree of nodes for only those production rules that would be used to parse
an assignment of an integer to a scalar variable. This required completing
parts of the expression rules, as well as the statement and scope/program
rules. Once complete, we were able to write a simple program that contained
only an assignment like this and look at the structure of the AST via printout
to see if it matched the expected node structure.

From there, we started building up additional branches of the tree. More
statements at first, then declarations, each time completing the parts of the
tree that each relied on and testing those specific rules.

We included in the tests directory a subdirectory called ast. This includes
the files we gradually built up from single statements and declarations into
larger programs as more and more of the AST was built. We used these files to
test at each step until we were satisfied the tree was coming together as
expected.

Once a first pass at the whole tree was complete, we began running it through
our semantic analysis procedure to determine if any tweaks were needed. Once
this was running smoothly, we added line and column number information from
the lexer into the AST nodes. We tested this by adding this information to
the error messages our semantic analyzer was outputting.

Semantic Analysis Testing

Document the testing that was done, what test cases
were used, and what parts of the compiler were tested.

We divided our semantic operator tests into passing and failing test cases,
and focused on tests for semantic operators in the declarations, statements 
checking, expression type checking, and functions, procedures and arguments
categories. 

We only wrote failing test cases for tests where we needed to check that 
each kind of identifier being declared was not already declared in the current 
scope. We did not write passing tests for such cases since we used declarations
for all kinds of identifiers in our other passing test cases. Thus, in the 
declarations category, we wrote failing tests for semantic operators s10 - s12, 
s15, s17 - s19, and s48. We also wrote both passing and failing test cases for
semantic operators s46 and s49.

In the statements checking category, we wrote both failing and passing test 
cases for all of those semantic operators. For the s50 failing test we tested
whether an error would occur both when the two kinds of exit statements were
enclosed in non-loop statements, a procedure scope, and when simply stated 
on their own. Similarly for s51, s52 fail tests we tested whether an error
would still occur if return/result statements where stated on their own, 
and in enclosing statements and function scopes etc.
