# A design document that describes how you designed your csc488.cups file.
#    Explain the issues that arose with the source language reference grammar
#    and how you resolved those issues





We design our csc488.cup file to follow the rules of reference grammar for most 
of the part. However, there are few issues with the reference grammar. One of them
is that some grammar has both left and right recursion like the rules in statement
where a statement can become multiple statements or the rules in expressions.

The way we deal with both left and right recursion is to try to reduce it so that
only left recursion appears in grammar. The way we did with multiple statements,
for example, is to declare a non-terminal A for every rule the statement can reduce
to and specify two rules in our grammar: statement ::= A | statement ::= statement A.
This way we only have the left recursion in our grammar and it has the same meaning as
before.
