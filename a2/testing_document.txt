# A document describing how you tested your csc488.cups file.
#    Include an index with a one sentence description of each test case.


passing test cases:

	A1a:
		 A program using all arithmetic, logical and conditional operators,
		 plus variable declaration and assignment.
	A1b:
		A program using variations on array declaration, bounds 
		and assignment.
	A1c:
		A program using all loop building and loop exit constructs,
		including the while and repeat loops along with the exit and
		exit when statements.  These loops essentially decrement/increment
		values until exit conditions are met.
	A1d:
		A program using non-recursive functions and procedures with and
		without parameters.
	A1e:
		 A program using recursive functions and procedures, with and without
		parameters. Includes a nested procedure and function declaration.
		These routines mostly repeatly output something or repeatedly read
		input until a certain value is seen.
	A1e_2:
		Same as A1e but the recursive function does not contain the get statement.
		This is done by using a global variable.
	declarations:
		Testing file with all test cases of declarations.
	expr:
		Testing file with all test cases of expressions.
	scope:
		Testing file with all test cases of scopes.
	stmts:
		Testing file with all test cases of statements.
	mutual_recursion:
		Testing file with test cases of mutual recursive procedures.
	other_tests:
		Testing file where all features of grammar combined together.


failing test cases:

	bad_expr:

	bad_expr2:

	bad_expr3:

	bad_expr4:

	bad_expr5:

	bad_stmt_before_decl:
			Statment appearing before declaration in scope should be rejected.
	bad_stmt:
			Misuse of statement as expression.
	bad_stmt2:
			Misuse of statement as expression.
	bad_stmt3:
			Misuse of curly brackets.
	bad_stmt4:
			Misuse of compare operator.
	bad_stmt5:
			Cannot have only declaration without statement.
	bad_stmt6:
			Misuse of function as a statement.
	bad_syntax:
			Missing do in a while statement.
	bad_var_name:
			Testing invalid variablenames.
